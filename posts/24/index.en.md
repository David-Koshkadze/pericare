What is the main detail that a pregnant woman should be prepared for in order to be less psychologically stressed after childbirth?

Pregnancy is a special period of a woman's life, along with joy and happiness, it often turns into a period of confusion, fear, anxiety, carelessness and depression. The conception of a new life, along with great expectations, is a great challenge for the body, and this responsible test awaits not only the physical, but also the mental health of a woman.

The reasons for excitement may be: fear of responsibility; fear of childbirth; changes in body shape; health problems;

If we consider motherhood as a psycho-social phenomenon, which should provide all the conditions for the child's development, we should touch upon the psychological state of the mother. Pregnancy and childbirth is quite stressful for a woman's physiology and psyche, along with hormonal changes, reality changes and adaptation to the new role of the mother, which may be accompanied by (postnatal) psycho-emotional complications.

For example: a new mother may not enjoy the process of caring for her baby, experience chronic fatigue and irritability, which may further intensify the feeling of guilt that she does not meet the parameters of the "ideal" mother. Sometimes there are thoughts that he cannot meet the needs of the child in quality, he does not have enough emotional and tactile contact with the baby. These thoughts and fears in pregnant women and new mothers may cause mood swings, weakness, listlessness, and sleep difficulties.

Mother's disturbing thoughts that she can't cope with her duties, constant changes in character, heightened sense of guilt and intense emotions may develop into more complex forms and even lead to anxiety disorders. Which, in turn, affects not only the mother, but also the child, and sometimes becomes the cause of aggression towards the child.

If a woman who has just given birth has weak symptoms listed above, has mild anxiety, a desire to cry, changes in character, and these symptoms do not last more than 2 weeks, we can assume that the woman has slowly rehabilitated, and if these symptoms do not change or intensify despite the passage of time, Then it is necessary to consult specialists (gynecologist, psychologist, neurologist, psychiatrist).

**Some activities that will help women to face childbirth**

Challenges and difficulties are individual and come in different forms and intensities. If a woman and her family are prepared, informed and face this unique period, all troubles and complications can be prevented.
For prevention, it is recommended to consult with a perinatal psychologist (a psychologist who works on fertility issues, pre- and post-natal period).

As recommendations, we advise new mothers to enjoy this unique period as much as possible, pregnancy and childbirth, this is the time when they should be focused only on themselves and their desires, relax, be in contact with their own feelings and desires - and then with the baby.

Ask for help from family members or friends, involve the father in the process, get his care and attention, make and share the time and schedule for taking care of the child, use free time to sleep and exercise, go for a walk or have fun.

Talk, sing to the unborn baby, and then actively share your emotions and feelings with the baby, this technique will help you to easily recognize your own and the baby's signals, and respond to these signals with appropriate sensitivity.

Periodically relax (3-5 minutes) - take a comfortable position, close your eyes and visualize a situation/place where you will feel calm, safe and secure, this will be your "ideal place". This technique helps to gain peace and balance, which has a positive impact on both the physical and emotional state, and overall human health. Relaxation/imagination helps one stay calm throughout the day.

It is important to communicate with your partner (if you have a partner), family and/or friends about your pregnancy. Also, sharing experience with women who are now going through the same process: pregnant women and mothers of newborns. To get such support, you can join various groups, including using social networks.

**Recommendations for partners and family members who are going through this difficult process**

Social factors such as: financial problems and poor living conditions, lack of support from family members and relatives, disharmonious or strained relationships with the partner also contribute to psycho-emotional complications after divorce. The partner's indifference during such a period has a very acute effect on the already sensitive psyche of a woman. A woman for whom career growth and social self-realization is a priority experiences this period very hard. It is also worth noting the physical discomfort that accompanies pregnancy/childbirth and postpartum physical rehabilitation: lowering of the small pelvic organs, incisions or post-cesarean incisions, typical pains and complications of lactation, weight gain, skin deformation, changed body shapes, which negatively affect a woman's self-esteem. It reflects and throws you into a great trial.

Partners and family members should pay attention and maximum support, both in terms of physical support and emotional support. Family members should refrain from criticism and negative evaluations/comparisons, understand and empathize with the woman's changed emotional state.
