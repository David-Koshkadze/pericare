To tell the difference between the baby blues and more serious postpartum depression, check in with the severity of your feelings, and note how long they last.

- The baby blues: With the baby blues, you’ll likely feel sad, worried and tired, but each of these will be on the mild side (as in, you perk up after a nap, a walk or talking with a friend). And these blue feelings tend to subside in two weeks without treatment.
- Postpartum depression: A case of PPD is a possibility if your teary days stretch longer than two weeks or you feel extremely anxious or deeply depressed. PPD is a more serious mood disorder and intense in nature, which means it requires treatment, often medication, therapy or a combination of the two, in order to feel like your old self again.
