After experiencing pregnancy together, it is important to create favorable conditions for childbirth, where mother and child feel strong and safe.

In a loving and caring environment, a mother can trust and understand her own emotions. The care, openness and acceptance of the birth staff make the birth experience a positive one. Nonverbal cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, tone of voice, and gestures are central to creating this atmosphere.

The synchronicity of feelings and bodily sensations allows the mother to have an emotional bond with the unborn child. The better and relaxed the mother feels, the baby is born relaxed, too.

The internal conversation between a pregnant woman and her unborn child directly affects the child's perception. The mother should be allowed to remain mentally and emotionally connected to the baby throughout the birth process.
Labor pains and uterine contractions prepare mother and baby for subsequent bonding by triggering the release of attachment-promoting hormones. The body's own opiates and endorphins are also released, which relieve pain and promote bonding.

By the end of labor, serotonin and noradrenaline are released to relieve pain, which also gives the mother strength to move and position her body. Noradrenaline helps the child adapt to physiological oxygen deficiency. Noradrenaline is also responsible for the wide-open eyes and dilated pupils of the newborn baby, which makes the mother so happy.

Maternal stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol cross the placental barrier and affect the wakefulness of the newborn after birth. Also, they activate his heart and independent breathing.

Pain prompts the mother to change position and move, which makes it easier for the baby's head to move in the pelvis.
Beta-endorphin, another of the body's own opiates, is a further pain-relieving and attachment-promoting substance, the release of which is stimulated when the mother moves.

Oxytocin is a hormone of decisive importance in all phases of labor. Its concentration reaches its maximum at the postnatal stage. At this time, touching, skin-to-skin contact of mother and baby is of crucial importance. Oxytocin acts as a hormone in the blood and as a neurotransmitter in the brain.

Through the activation of mirror neurons, mother and child unconsciously mirror each other in sensory and motor contexts. Skin-to-skin contact allows the baby to adjust its own temperature to that of the mother, which we can consider a primitive form of reflection. This primal, primitive form influences classical forms of reflection and allows the mother to observe both her own and the baby's sensations. Observing sensations reduces fear, feelings of inferiority, alienation, which often accompany the postpartum phase. Observing sensations helps the mother, in such a close relationship as the mother-infant relationship, to separate her own feelings from those of the child.

Synchronized reflection and separation of one's own and the child's feelings creates an opportunity for a solid and secure attachment pattern to develop.
