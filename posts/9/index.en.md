Perineal wounds are classified into four degrees: first degree involves the perineal skin and vaginal mucosa; the second degree involves the muscles and skin of the perineum; The third degree extends from the vaginal wall to the anal fissure, and the fourth degree extends to the anus or rectum. Third and fourth degree injuries are considered severe perineal trauma. The rate of perineal trauma during physiological childbirth is 1-3% in European countries, and 2.2-19% in America. A 2006 study of 377 primiparous women found that women with third- and fourth-degree perineal lesions were five times less likely to be sexually active than women with intact perineum.

Perineal tears are classified in 4 degrees: the 1st degree involves the fourchette, perineal skin, and vaginal mucous membrane. 2nd-degree tears involve the perineal muscles and skin. 3rd-degree tears extend from the vaginal wall and perineum to the anal sphincter and 4th-degree tears extend to the anus or rectum. Severe perineal trauma is defined as a 3rd-degree or 4th-degree tear. The reported rate of severe perineal trauma among vaginal deliveries is 1-3% in European countries and 2.219% in USA. A prospective study in 2006 with 377 primiparous
women found that women were 5 times less likely to be sexually active after a 3rd/4th-degree anal sphincter tear compared with women with an intact perineum. A systematic review of 14 studies performed in 2015 compared women with 3rd or 4th degree laceration with women without major injuries. 4 of the 14 studies found that women with 3rd or 4th degree laceration suffered from dyspareunia significantly, more frequently, and for longer duration. The frequency of dyspareunia with severe perineal trauma compared to 1st- and 2nd-degree tears at 3 months postpartum was 32-55% vs 51-64%, respectively. The rate of resumption of sexual activity in women with third- and fourth-degree perineal injuries was very low at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.

A more recent study compared women with third and fourth degree perineal injuries and women who had an episiotomy or minor incision. The study showed that third and fourth degree perineal injuries negatively affected women's sexual functioning 6 months or 1 year after childbirth. Severe trauma to the perineum during childbirth is associated with decreased postpartum sexual function, higher rates of dyspareunia, and longer time needed to resume sexual activity. On the other hand, first and second degree lesions of the perineum do not have a significant effect on dyspareunia in the postnatal period.
