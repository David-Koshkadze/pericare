Keep in mind that the “baby blues” will likely fade in the first two weeks as you adjust to your new life and get more rest. In the meantime, here are some tips to help lift you out of a postpartum slump:

- **Lower the bar.** Remember, you won’t be overwhelmed for long. After a week or two, you're likely to feel much more comfortable in those parental shoes. For now, lower your expectations for yourself — and then lower them some more. Make this your mantra: There's no such thing as a perfect parent or a perfect baby.
- **Don't go it alone.** Trying to deal with a crying newborn, that mountain of spit-up-stained laundry and a sink full of dirty dishes all by yourself is beyond depressing, especially if you add in the promise of another sleepless night. Ask for support from your partner, mother, sister or friends.
- **Treat yourself.** Consider a movie, a dinner date with your partner (even if you just order in and light some candles), a quick manicure or just a long shower. Occasionally make yourself, and not baby care or housework, a priority. You deserve it!
- **Leave the house.** It's amazing what a change of scenery and some fresh air can do for your state of mind. Plan an outing at least once a day: Take your baby to the park or go for a walk outside with friends (and, if your friends are also new moms, you can swap sob stories — and then laugh!).
- **Snack the right way.** New moms are often too busy feeding their babies to feed themselves — a big no-no, since low blood sugar send energy levels and moods plummeting. To stay on an even keel, keep healthy snacks handy (cheese sticks, veggies, fruit, cereal, trail mix).
- **Stay hydrated.** New moms, especially those who breastfeed, need to keep up their liquids. Stash a water bottle or flavored seltzer where you nurse, burp or rock your baby. But ease up on alcohol, as it can dry you out, affect your mood and make you feel worse, plus drinking and baby care don’t mix.
- **Cry - and laugh.** If you need a good cry, go for it. But when you're done, turn on your favorite sitcom and laugh too. You know what they say: Laughter is the best medicine. Go online to find silly memes or TikToks or follow a hilarious Instagram handle for a fast chuckle any time you need it.

Still blue, no matter what you do? Keep on reminding yourself that you'll likely outgrow the “baby blues” within a week or two — most moms do — though if feelings of depression persist or worsen, make an appointment to speak with your practitioner about your symptoms.
