**Common perinatal obsessions are:**

- Disturbing thoughts that you might hurt your child during pregnancy;
- Disturbing thoughts that you will sexually harm your child;
- Fear that the child may have or develop a serious health problem;
- Fear that you may make the wrong decision. For example, take the wrong medicine or get a vaccine;

These thoughts can manifest in a very depressing and frightening way. It is necessary to remember that these thoughts are paradoxical and not based on real circumstances.

**Common perinatal compulsions are:**

- Constant washing of clothes, dishes and toys;
- Avoiding changing the baby's diaper for fear of touching it in the wrong place or in the wrong place;
- removing the child from other people, limiting or prohibiting contact with others for fear that they may harm him;
- Constant examination of the child. For example, waking up during sleep that is really good;
- Ask the child frequently with family members to make sure that you do not feel sorry for the child.

Obsessions and compulsions can be overwhelming, but there are steps you can take to help you deal with them:

- Raise awareness of perinatal OCD from trusted sources. Get the information provided by the specialist.
- Talk to someone you trust and share your thoughts if you feel like it. Tell people how they can help and get that help.
- Contact a mental health professional.
