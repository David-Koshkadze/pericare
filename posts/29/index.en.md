Pregnancy and the post-pregnancy period, despite the presence of favorable and supportive conditions, are considered high-risk periods - both in terms of physical and mental health.

We understand that the separation of especially vulnerable groups is conditional during the war. However, based on certain criteria, we can say that pregnant women and women with newborn children require special attention and care.

-	Pregnancy and the post-pregnancy period are associated with a high rate of stress, which is exacerbated during wartime;
-	The existing expectations for women, that they should be able to maintain the pregnancy and take care of the newborn under any circumstances, makes it difficult for women to process the war traumas;
-	Risky pregnancy and difficult childbirth increase the risk of suicide. In war conditions, this risk increases even more;
-	In times of war, the demands on women as caretakers of the next generation are especially high. Caring for the next generation is impossible without promoting women's mental health;
