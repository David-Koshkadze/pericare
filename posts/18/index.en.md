Many of the most common postpartum depression symptoms look the same as regular depression symptoms. And while the postpartum blues, which nearly 80 percent of moms experience in the first few weeks after delivery, tend to fade away, PPD stays with you longer, and your sadness and anxiety gets more intense and pervasive.

You may have postpartum depression if you experience any of these symptoms almost every day:

- Extreme sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness;
- Crying all the time;
- Loss of interest or lack of enjoyment in your usual activities and hobbies;
- Trouble falling sleep at night, or trouble staying awake during the day;
- Loss of appetite or eating too much, or unintentional weight loss or weight gain;
- Overwhelming feelings of worthlessness or overpowering guilt;
- Restlessness or sluggishness;
- Difficulty concentrating or making decisions;
- Feeling that life isn't worth living;
- Severe mood swings;
- Difficulty bonding with your baby;
- Severe anxiety;
- Thoughts of harming yourself or your baby.

Other possible signs you might be depressed include:

- Being extremely irritable or angry;
- Avoiding friends and family;
- Worrying excessively about your baby;
- Worrying that you're not a good parent;
- Being uninterested in your baby, or unable to care for them;
- Feeling so much postpartum fatigue that you're unable to get out of bed for hours.
