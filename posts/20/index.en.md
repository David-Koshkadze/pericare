**Recommendations for women: How to take care of yourself during perinatal depression**

- Be kind to yourself. Try not to beat yourself up because of things don't go according to plan or don't work out. You shouldn't feel guilty about it. Treat yourself as you would with your best friend.
- Observe yourself, your emotions: what makes you uncomfortable and what makes you happy. For this, itâ€™s very effective keeping a mood diary. This will help you to monitor your emotions and state. Record good days and feelings, activities, places or people who made you feel good. This will motivate you.
- Try to set aside at least 15 minutes of private time for yourself every day. Take a break and spend a few minutes doing an activity you enjoy.
- Pay attention to hygiene. When a person is depressed, hygiene may not be a priority. But remember, small changes can cause big changes. Get yourself organized, even if you don't plan to leave home, it will still be good for your emotions.
- Talk to people who have similar experiences. Sometimes, women think that they are the only ones who experience similar feelings after pregnancy or childbirth and that they do not have a partner. Women should know that they are not the first to experience similar emotions, millions of mothers around the world suffer from these feelings.
- Ask for help from family members or friends. Involve father in the process, get his care and attention. Create and share childcare times and schedules, and use your free time to sleep and exercise, go for walks or have fun.
- Consult a professional. Don't wait for time to pass and take care of your mental health. Don't panic and monitor the frequency and intensity of your symptoms. If you find that these symptoms are interfering with your daily activities and functioning, be sure to consult a professional.
