Living with the effects of trauma is a difficult challenge, but there are ways to deal with it.

**Get to know your triggers.** You may think that certain experiences, situations, or people bring back painful memories. They may be a constant source of injury. For example, smell, taste, sound, words, places and people. Specific dates are especially difficult, such as a child's birth date or something else. 

**Trust someone.** With post-traumatic stress disorder, it's hard to open up to someone. At this time, it is common to feel that it is difficult to talk about a given topic or that no one will understand you. However, you should remember that you don't have to include the traumatic event, you can just talk about your feelings and emotions. It would be better if you turn to a professional to talk, he will direct the conversation more correctly and would be helpful. 

**Give yourself time.** Everyone needs their own time and pace to overcome an injury. Don't rush to talk if you feel you can't. Be patient with yourself. Don't beat yourself up or blame yourself, time is of the essence in PTSD.
Get into group therapy. You can share your situation with people who have similar experience.
Take care of your physical health. Taking care of your physical body will also benefit your emotions. Hygiene, self-care, healthy eating, walking and other non-fatiguing physical activities will help you to restore psycho-emotional balance.
