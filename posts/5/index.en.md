According to current research, the importance of attachment for a child's mental and physical health is beyond doubt. Current 2021 research addresses the importance of breastfeeding and sensitive infant touch as indicators of mother-infant interaction and attachment formation, as well as infant brain development. According to the study, mothers who breastfed their children were more sensitive to touch than those who were bottle fed. Early research confirms that eye-to-eye and skin-to-skin contact with a child is crutial to a child's brain development. Specialists recognize that attachment and breastfeeding are interconnected and interdependent in many ways, and that breastfeeding can help build healthy attachments.

When there is a close relationship between the mother and the child, between the father and the child, the level of the hormone oxytocin increases significantly in the blood (both in the body of the mother and the baby). The hormone oxytocin is often called the hormone of love, attachment and hugs. A large amount of the hormone oxytocin is released during breastfeeding. Therefore, breastfeeding is of immeasurably great importance for the mental and physical health of the mother.
