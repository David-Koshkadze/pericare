**What is anxiety**

Anxiety is a feeling of mental discomfort caused by strong emotions. Often, if these emotions are intense and of a negative nature, they become a sense of impending danger in our psyche. The state of anxiety is very similar to fear, however, unlike fear, it does not involve a specific, real (here and now) threat, but an imaginary, permissible threat and is always projected into the future. This is a kind of ominous preconception that may be based on past experience or may be imagined.

Anxiety affects thought systems and can completely engulf an individual. Because of this, it is difficult for a person to organize her emotions and thoughts in the usual way, it becomes difficult to adapt to the environment, to function daily, and he is constantly in "survival" - fighting mode.

**What is perinatal anxiety?**

During pregnancy and post-pregnancy, women often experience perinatal anxiety. According to recent studies, 1 in 5 women experience perinatal anxiety. Anxiety is a natural reaction that people experience when they feel vulnerable or threatened. Thus, perinatal anxiety involves changes in a person's thoughts, actions, feelings, and body sensations during pregnancy and after the birth of the baby.

Many people have heard about postnatal anxiety, but less people know that anxiety can also occur in a woman during pregnancy, which is called antenatal anxiety.
