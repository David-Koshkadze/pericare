“It's the best of times and the worst of times”. This isn’t only a famous line from Charles Dickens — it’s also how up to 80 percent of new mothers feel for a few days or weeks after childbirth. These feelings are often called the "baby blues," because they seem to appear (appropriately) out of the blue, bringing on unexpected feelings of sadness and irritability, bouts of crying, restlessness and anxiety.

But these emotions also make new mothers feel blue, as in down in the dumps, and this mood can be especially disconcerting since having a baby is supposed to make you happy, not miserable. Take heart, and know that while the baby blues aren’t much fun, they’re often quite temporary, which means you’ll soon be back to normal and ready to face the day (and your baby!) with a smile.

**What are the “baby blues”?**

The baby blues, which are also sometimes called the postpartum blues, are feelings of sadness that many women experience in the early days after giving birth. This blue mood tends to kick in on day 2 or 3 postpartum and can last for a few weeks. But there’s good news: Very often, the “baby blues” go away on their own, without any special treatment, intervention or medication.

**What are the symptoms of the “baby blues”?**

The symptoms of the baby blues may include one or more of the following:

• Sadness, moodiness, anxiety;
• Crying spells;
• Loss of appetite;
• Trouble sleeping;
• Feeling overwhelmed by baby tasks;
• Irritability;
• Difficulty concentrating or making decisions.

**What causes the “baby blues”?**

It's actually easy to understand why the “baby blues” can crop up if you step back and take an objective look at what's going on in your life, your body and with your emotions in the days after you give birth. Here’s what’s happening:

- **Changes in hormone levels.** Estrogen and progesterone drop precipitously after childbirth.
- **A tough delivery.** A physically debilitating labor followed by an exhausting homecoming — all compounded by the round-the-clock demands of newborn care — can make any new mom feel overwhelmed.
- **Shock and guilt when you see your baby.** You might be struggling with mixed emotions about your new role as a parent.
- **Difficulties breastfeeding**. Sore nipples, painful engorgement, latching issues and more can make the first few weeks postpartum incredibly challenging.
- **Stress in your relationship.** You may wonder if your romantic life will ever return to the way it used to be.

With such an overwhelming laundry list of challenges to confront, it's no wonder you might be feeling a little down.
