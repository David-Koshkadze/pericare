**Time To Talk**

During the war, all people suffer, regardless of their distinguishing features. There are harms that war victims and eyewitnesses are relatively ready to talk about and the public is ready to listen to. Among the topics left out of the conversation are topics such as: rape, sexual harassment, gender-based humiliation and torture, post-torture or post-war reproductive dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, damage to reproductive organs, limited access to hygiene products, and many other untold atrocities. Often, women are not ready to talk about these topics, they think that "forgetting" is a better solution, they are afraid that if they talk, they will be further ostracized from society, or at least the closest people will reject them.

Among the topics left out of conversation, there are such topics, avoidance of conversation, we call "vow of silence", which applies to both sexes, although women apply it more often, due to stigmas and stereotypes in society. In addition to the willingness of the victims, society also does not know how to listen to them, how to comfort them and help them cope.

In addition to lack of knowledge, fear also prevents society from taking steps. We know that watching human suffering and torture leaves a very heavy mark on our psyche and forces us to focus on our survival instinct. We, the women who witness the war from a relatively far distance, are also afraid. We fear that one day we ourselves or our children may find ourselves in the same situation. This fear is so terrifying, we prefer to know less and listen less to women who have been through it. If no one listens, we neither speak nor tell our story.

"Not talking", "forgetting" is not the solution. Trauma can only be dealt with if we acknowledge its existence. If you don't have someone to talk to, contact a specialist. If not possible, draw or write about what you are experiencing. Talking about what hurts most, what scares us the most, gives us the opportunity to reduce its heavy impact, both on us personally and socially.

Let's talk when we're ready. Let's not speed up this process, let's not limit time. When it's time to talk, when you're ready to talk, the listener will be able to listen, and the resulting relationship will break the chain of fear and trauma and ease the pain.

Don't compare our injuries to others. Pain and emotion have no weight and dimension. We will tell all our stories, the main thing is to break the "vow of silence".
