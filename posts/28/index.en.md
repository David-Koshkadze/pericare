**Stress, Fear, and Also: Childbirth Versus The War and Its Psychological Consequences**

Giving birth in a basement, during the bombardment, can be much more painful and have a negative impact on the emotional bonding between mother and baby. All over the world, in times of war and in conflict zones, women give birth to children in completely inappropriate, harsh conditions.

When a woman's vulnerable situation, such as childbirth, is accompanied by being in an extremely dangerous situation, it can lead to complex consequences, both during childbirth and in the long term. Pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period require calmness. When bombs are exploding next to you, it is impossible to keep calm.

**Before birth: Prenatal stress programming**

Living in fear of a bombing or similar extreme stressful situation can affect an unborn baby. Our body reacts to such stressful experiences in the same way it did in the Stone Age with an alarm signal, prompting us to seek the best chance of survival. At this time, a large amount of the hormone cortisol is released in our body.

Cortisol is a stress hormone and enters the child's circulatory system from the mother's circulatory system through the placental barrier. In the case of daily life stress, the amount of cortisol is so small that it can not have a negative impact on the child's development. In a war situation, a large amount of cortisol reaches the child, which can lead to high stress sensitivity - the so-called "prenatal stress programming".

"Prenatal stress programming" leads to a newborn who cries a lot, has difficulty calming down, and/or has feeding and sleeping difficulties. At a later age, the child may experience longer and stronger stress due to problems at school or university. Also, physical health problems such as high blood pressure and circulatory problems may appear based on the stress experienced by the mother before birth.

Of course, all this is not necessary. There are quite resilient children whose mothers have gone through the worst of conditions, but still thrive. We are talking about the probability that war and adverse conditions can cause.

**Birth: Closeness and support can compensate many things**

Being born under conditions such as a bombardment or a basement evacuation can have dramatic consequences. The situation is dangerous especially for women who give birth to their first child.

Even during normal maternity conditions, we meet the so-called "black box effect" because women do not know exactly what they may expect during the birth process and feel helpless and desperate. During childbirth, a woman's body becomes a guide and it is almost impossible to control the process. When bombs are falling outside, then this sensation increases dramatically.

Increased fear, stress and tension lead to longer, more difficult and painful births. Against the background of stress, the ability to squeeze may decrease and retention of uterine contractions may develop. In addition, the baby's oxygen supply worsens, because the mother's arteries narrow due to stress and the uterus is poorly supplied with blood.

We can unequivocally say that closeness, compassion and support can work against the worst external conditions. When a woman has a reliable, supportive person by her side during labor and the medical staff manages to make the woman feel cared for despite everything, it can compensate for a lot. Even when the circumstances are not conducive to the birth of a new life, the presence of human interaction between the birth mother and the medical/support staff is of crucial importance.

**After birth: the affected mother-child relationship**

The stress of war or displacement also has a strong negative impact on the postnatal period. A woman no longer has the feeling of solidity and security, because she does not know if she will be alive tomorrow, if her house is still standing or if she will ever be able to return home.

Post-traumatic stress disorder is the most undesirable thing that can develop after giving birth under difficult conditions. This may happen without war, but the risk is much higher in extreme situations. Mother is much less able to communicate with the child, because she is in a difficult situation, which significantly damages the relationship between the mother and the child. It is also common for a mother to be so preoccupied with survival that she no longer has the mental resources to care for her child emotionally. This damages the mother-child relationship both now and in the future.

However, the massive damage of the negative impact is not necessary. In such extreme situations, giving birth can further strengthen the bond between mother and child. A woman can gain strength and resources from the experience of being able to give birth even under such conditions. This strength and resource helps her in her relationship with the child to feel capable, caring, which creates a good basis for dealing with trauma and promotes the future relationship between mother and child.
