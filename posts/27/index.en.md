As recommendations, we advise new mothers to enjoy this unique period as much as possible, pregnancy and childbirth, this is the time when they should be focused only on themselves and their desires and relax, be in contact with their own feelings and desires - and then with the baby.

-	Ask for help from family members or friends, involve the father in the process, accept his care and attention with gratitude, make and share a time and schedule for taking care of the child, use free time to sleep and exercise, go for a walk or have fun.
-	Talk, sing to the baby in your bely and then actively share your emotions and feelings with the baby, this technique will help you to easily recognize your own and the baby's signals, and respond to these signals with appropriate sensitivity.
-	Periodically resort to relaxation (3-5 minutes) - security posture, close the determination and imagine a place where you can feel calm, safe and secure, this will be the "ideal place". This technique is conducive to gaining peace and balance, which has a positive effect on the physical, as well as emotional state, and overall human health. Relaxation/imagination should be maintained throughout the day.
-	Ask for social support. It is important to communicate with your partner (if you have a partner), family and/or friends about your pregnancy. Also, sharing experience with women who are now going through this process: pregnant women and mothers of newborns. To get such support, you can join various groups, including using social networks.
-	If you are worried, know that you are not alone. Fear, anxiety, difficulty adjusting to a new role is very natural, especially in the case of a first or unplanned pregnancy.
-	Partners and family members should show attention and maximum support both in terms of physical support and emotional support. Family members should refrain from criticism and negative evaluations/comparisons, understand and empathize with the woman's changed emotional state.
