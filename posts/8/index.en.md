A woman's sexual health is a vital and important part of life at any age. In particular, pregnancy and childbirth cause biological, psychological and social changes that can affect a woman's sexual health. Studies have shown that sexual function decreases during pregnancy and does not return to baseline levels postpartum. This is partly due to body changes, lack of sleep, tension, urinary stress and various complaints. Despite the complexity and complexity of this topic, health care providers often neglect the sexual aspects of pregnancy and the postpartum period.

In the postpartum period, a woman has a significant deterioration of the sexual sphere. Such as: dyspareunia, lack of vaginal lubrication, difficulty reaching orgasm, vaginal bleeding or irritation after intercourse and loss of sexual desire. Research shows that 89% of women resume sexual activity within 6 months after giving birth. Prevalence rates of sexual dysfunction range from 41% to 83% at 2-3 months postpartum, and 64% at 6 months postpartum. More than 18 months after giving birth, women have dramatically lower levels of sexual pleasure and emotional satisfaction. The high prevalence rate of sexual disorders in the postpartum period has a significant impact on the quality of life of women.

Childbirth is associated with short-term damage to the perineum and long-term changes in the pelvic bone. Researchers are interested in whether these changes are related to sexual functioning. A small number of studies have shown an association between vaginal delivery and sexual dysfunction. In one of the larger studies, Griffiths examined 208 women two years after giving birth who had dyspareunia, depression, sexual dissatisfaction, urinary and fecal incontinence. With the help of a questionnaire, Griffiths revealed a significant decrease in sexual satisfaction in women who gave birth physiologically rather than by caesarean section. Women who delivered naturally had more urinary and fecal incontinence, depression, and dyspareunia than women who delivered by cesarean section.

Barrett studied 484 women: compared their condition in the third trimester of pregnancy and 6 months after childbirth. Compared to the period of pregnancy, pains, lack of vaginal lubrication, loss of sexual desire increased significantly in the first 3 months after delivery, but these problems started to decrease after about 6 months after delivery. Based on the study, it was found that dyspareunia during the first 3 months after delivery was significantly associated with physiological delivery. However, there was no significant difference at 6 months.
