Feeling anxious is very depressing and distressing in the process of daily functioning.

Here are some techniques on how you can deal with an anxiety attack yourself:

- Try to direct your attention to some subject or object. The smaller the object, the better; If you can, direct all your thoughts to this one object and observe the details: shape, color, texture, structure, location, this will help you calm down.

- Learn breathing exercises. Breathing exercises don't just involve deep breathing, you need to learn how to breathe properly. Breath control is a unique tool for dealing with unpleasant physical sensations and anxiety.

- Try to engage in physical activity. It will take your mind off your mind and help you clear up the overwhelming, unpleasant energy. For this, it is not necessary to engage in sports. You can do any physical activity - go for a walk, do some physical work around the house, even wash or iron.
