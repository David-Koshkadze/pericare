As soon as you see two lines on the pregnancy test, the perinatal bonding begins to develop between the mother and the embryo, which at this time is a small ball of cells, and these cells have the ability to pulsate. Even the first group of embryonic cells are receptive to rhythmic beats, which may be related to the ability to respond to the mother's heartbeat. This synchronous pulsation is necessary for the embryo to form its own heart.

Neuronal development, in the broadest sense of the word, is conditioned by the mother's heartbeat, breathing and movement. The attachment system between the embryo and the mother in the womb is programmed and plays a crucial role in the development of the prenatal brain, especially in the formation of the limbic system and the trunk.

The mother's blood supply system, which is connected to the baby through the placenta and umbilical cord, gives rise to physical sensations, which later become the basis for mental sensations. We call the change of positive and stressful feelings - the “umbilical cord effect”, which begins to function in the fifth week after conception and continues until birth.

The development of mental skills, competent behavior and appropriate regulation of affect is related to the development of the child's brain during pregnancy.

A child who has a strong prenatal attachment develops a neural network for self-worth and stress resilience. Prenatal stress, abuse, and neglect are experiences that alter the synaptic connections in the bifrontal cortex in such a way that the child's development is at risk emotionally, cognitively, and psychologically.

The origin of emotions is connected to the whole body, and the heart is connected to the brain and the body in various ways. Each heartbeat sends many nerve signals to the brain. The heart receives information through hormones, heart rate, and heart pressure. It then converts this information into a nerve impulse and shares it with the brain.

The heart, as a pulsating organ, is the bioenergetic and emotional center of attachment. The embryo is closely related to the mother's sensations and adapts to the given context in a continuum. With the connection between the heart and the brain, our instincts, feelings and thoughts are in harmony with each other.

When the mother is afraid, stress hormones (adrenaline and cortisol) are released in large quantities into the blood. The mother's heart starts to work faster. Adrenaline narrows the blood vessels of the internal organs and, accordingly, their oxygen supply is delayed. Through the placenta, the physiological reaction of fear and danger is transferred to the child. Increased movement or, conversely, immobility may be the result of this reaction and can be observed ultrasoundally. This pattern applies to a whole range of emotions, not just fear.

Chemical communication between mother and child begins at conception. Both the physical and mental state of the mother's body is transmitted to the embryo through hormones and other transmitters. Mirror neurons in the womb also play an important role in feeling emotion.

During pregnancy, the child is attached to the mother's emotional state, and the degree of attachment is laid during pregnancy.

If we put the individual responsibility of "being well" on the mother, it will not improve her mental well-being, but rather increase her feelings of guilt and inadequacy. A mother's well-being is a systemic task for the well-being of the next generation and society as a whole.
