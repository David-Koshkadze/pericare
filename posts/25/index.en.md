Pregnancy is a special period of a woman's life. But often, along with joy and happiness, pregnancy turns into a period of confusion, fear, anxiety, thoughtlessness and depression. The conception of a new life, along with great expectations, is a great challenge for the body, and this responsible test awaits not only the physical, but also the mental health of a woman. The reasons for excitement may be: fear of responsibility, fear of childbirth, changes in body shape, health problems.

If we consider motherhood as a psycho-social phenomenon, which should provide all the conditions for the child's development, we should touch on the mother's psychological condition. Pregnancy and childbirth are quite stressful for a woman's physiology and psyche, along with hormonal changes, reality changes and adaptation to the new role of the mother takes place, which may be accompanied by (postnatal) psycho-emotional complications. For example, a new mother may not enjoy the process of caring for an infant, experience chronic fatigue and irritability, which can further intensify the feeling of guilt that she does not meet the parameters of the "ideal" mother. Sometimes there are thoughts that she cannot meet the needs of the child in quality and she does not have enough emotional and tactile contact with the baby. These thoughts and fears in a pregnant, new mother may cause mood swings, weakness, lack of gratitude and sleep difficulties.

The mother's disturbing thoughts that she cannot cope with her duties, constant changes in character, heightened feelings of guilt and intense emotions may develop into even more complex forms and even lead to anxiety disorders. Which, in turn, affects not only the mother, but also the child, and sometimes becomes the cause of aggression towards the child.

If a new mother has weak symptoms listed above, has mild anxiety, a desire to cry, changes in character, and these symptoms do not last more than 2 weeks, we can assume that the woman has slowly rehabilitated, and if these symptoms do not change or intensify despite the passage of time, then It is necessary to consult specialists (gynecologist, psychologist, neurologist, psychiatrist).
