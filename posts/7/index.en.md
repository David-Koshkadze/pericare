We can compare the birthing process to a trauma and divide it into mild, medium and severe degrees in terms of results. Childbirth is traumatic both physically and mentally. It is crucial to have a supportive environment during labor by the medical staff, to minimize the need for medical manipulations and to provide anesthesia at the right dose. A postpartum woman needs time to gather resources and cope with the consequences of childbirth, during which time support from her partner and family members, as well as from medical staff and the community, is also crucial.

The postpartum period about 2-6 weeks is artistically called "the days of melancholy", "crying days", and in scientific language "Baby Blues". About 2-6 weeks after giving birth, frequent mood swings, feeling of emptiness, hypervigilance, tearfulness, often wanting to cry, feeling alienated from the baby and oneself - are common and are considered a normal reaction to the experienced stress. 

If the condition improves after about week six, it means that our mental coping mechanisms are working, and if there is no improvement it is important that support services are available to prevent further complications.

In conclusion, we can say that pregnancy, childbirth and the post-pregnancy period are challenging and stressful times in a woman's life. which puts his mental well-being at risk. It is important to inform women about possible difficulties and provide them with support services. Also, increasing the sensitivity of medical personnel, which is of preventive importance.

Supporting women's mental and physical well-being during the perinatal period leads to significant reductions in adverse outcomes for women, their partners, family members, children and society as a whole.
