Postpartum depression stems from a combination of hormonal, environmental, and genetic factors that are all beyond your control. There's nothing you do or don't do that causes PPD.

When you're pregnant, your estrogen and progesterone levels skyrocket. Within a day of giving birth, these hormones drop to pre-pregnancy levels. That sudden shift – similar to the hormonal swings you might feel before your period but magnified – play a role in PPD developing.

For some women, a drop in your thyroid hormone levels – which also happens after giving birth – can cause postpartum thyroiditis, with symptoms similar to those of depression. This condition usually shows up four to 12 months after delivery. Your provider can do a blood test to tell if your thyroid is causing your symptoms and prescribe thyroid medicine if necessary. It's helpful to let your provider know if thyroid disease runs in your family.

Other factors that contribute to the development of PPD include physical exhaustion after giving birth, sleep deprivation, and the emotional roller coaster of becoming a parent.

What are the risk factors for postpartum depression?

- A history of past depression. Women who have been depressed in the past are more than 20 times more likely to experience PPD;
- Depression or anxiety during pregnancy;
- Stressful life events during pregnancy or soon after giving birth;
- A traumatic childbirth experience;
- Preterm labor and birth;
- Having a baby in neonatal intensive care;
- Lack of support from family and friends;
- Relationship problems;
- Breastfeeding problems;
- Unresolved childhood trauma.

Other risk factors include:

- An unplanned or unwanted pregnancy;
- A baby born with birth defects or other medical problems;
- Multiple babies (such as twins or triplets);
- A family history of psychiatric problems;
- Being a single parent;
- Money problems or unemployment;
- Domestic violence;
- Pregnancy complications;
- Pregestational or gestational diabetes.
  Remember that these risk factors don't actually cause PPD. Many women with multiple risk factors will never experience clinical depression or anxiety, while others with just one risk factor (or even none) end up with a diagnosis of postpartum depression.
