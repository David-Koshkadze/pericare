Perinatal OCD, or obsessive-compulsive disorder, is a form of anxiety that occurs during pregnancy or within a year after giving birth. Obsessive-compulsive disorder includes obsessions and compulsions.

Obsessions are unwanted thoughts, images, needs, worries, and doubts that keep recurring in the mind. They can be very annoying. Some describe them as "mental discomfort" rather than anxiety.

Compulsions are repetitive actions that a person performs to avoid the distress and anxiety caused by obsessions. For example, an obsession may be the obsessive thought that the door is not locked and someone might break it, while a compulsion is the incessant checking of the door lock or the ritualistic, countable number of pulls and the very short-lived bringing relief.

It is natural to worry about your child's health and think about how to protect him during pregnancy and after childbirth. But if you suffer from obsessive or compulsive symptoms that affect your well-being and functioning on a daily basis, you may be suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder. Obsessions and compulsions can be parenting or child related.
