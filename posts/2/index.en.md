Fear Characteristics Of The Perinatal Period

Pregnant women are often very worried about the impending birth and stay awake at night due to fear. Their fears are diverse, they worry about possible complications of childbirth, the health of the child, unforeseen difficulties, etc. They may have disturbing questions, thoughts, and fantasies, such as:

- "I'm not in a good mood always, will that hurt my unborn baby?"
- â€œSometimes, I'm afraid of what awaits me. Is it normal?"
- "How can I communicate with my child and support his development?"
- "What should I do if, despite everything, the child cries and does not sleep?"
- "What should I do if I have to completely give up my life, my needs?"
- "Wouldn't I pamper the child if his needs are met immediately?"
- "How should I manage so that my stress does not transfer to the child?"

Pregnant women often think about the difficulty of distinguishing between false symptoms and real signs of labor. It doesn't matter if the symptoms are real or fake, pregnant women should consult a doctor for any discomfort or unusual symptoms. It is important for to be in constant contact with the doctor, who advises her, based on her symptoms, how to behave, which will give the pregnant woman the opportunity to arrive at the maternity hospital on time.

Expectant mothers cannot imagine that it is possible to keep calm in the maternity ward, although it is not difficult. They should understand that they are surrounded by professionals and the birthing process is under active supervision.
Mothers need to realize that their emotions will also be transferred to the child. Mother and baby are a team, so it is important for the mother to remain calm so that the birthing process goes smoothly for both of them.

Pregnant women also fear the need for a c-section during labor and think that the procedure is painful, but it is not and episiotomy is painless.

Pregnant women should regularly receive advice from professionals during pregnancy. This will protect them from the influence of unnecessary fears and prejudices.

Yoga has a very good effect on pregnant women, which helps them relax.

A pregnant woman should use any opportunity to relax and pamper herself. It is important for a pregnant woman to create a positive atmosphere around her to raise her mood and neutralize her fears about childbirth. The ceremony of guessing the gender, buying clothes and things for the baby, decorating the baby's room, arranging photo sessions - all this will help the pregnant woman to distract herself and overcome her fears of childbirth.

The most important thing is that the pregnant woman believes in herself and trusts her body.
