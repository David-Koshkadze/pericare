Postnatal PTSD is a form of anxiety. It can also be called a birth trauma. You may be suffering from PTSD if you had a traumatic experience with your baby during childbirth or after the birth.

Postnatal PTSD can be caused by: difficult childbirth; Prolonged or painful childbirth; unplanned caesarean section; unexpected intervention; surprise regarding the child's health; Other unexpected, shocking traumatic events during the birth process.

Some women think that after having and seeing a child, traumatic experiences will be forgotten, although this may not be the case. Traumatic events can have a negative impact on your emotions, which can affect your relationships with your child or people around you.

You may feel that having a baby was not at all what you assumed or imagined. You may also feel angry at the medical staff for not managing the birth as it should have been. Your experiences can influence your attitude toward subsequent pregnancies.
