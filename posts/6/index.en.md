The birth of a child is a special event in a woman's life. After giving birth, not only the body has to undergo significant reorganization, but also the psyche. After birth, the mother must care for the baby, produce milk, breastfeed, and at the same time, her body must cope with the rapid decline in placental hormones. Also, it takes a lot of effort on the part of the baby to adjust to be able to change the usual skills for the period of pregnancy and to develop the skills of independent feeding - the development of the sucking reflex. At the same time, the baby is loaded with a lot of emotions, which he has to deal with with the help of his mother. Skin-to-skin contact between parent and child is of great importance in the transitional process of assuming the role of mother and child's development. Skin-to-skin contact helps stimulate the desire to breastfeed.

The mother-infant relationship, which begins with skin-to-skin contact, is related to the psychological concept of attachment for psychologists. Attachment implies the presence of a strong emotional support for the child, a strong emotional connection between the child and the person who cares for him, which allows the child to learn about the surrounding world with less fear. Attachment readiness is genetically coded. It is a complex concept and includes the neural connections that shape the emotional and behavioral components.

However, this complex neuroendocrine process is a great challenge for mother and child and is often associated with difficulties. Many mothers are unable to breastfeed their children due to their physical or mental conditions. Often, artificial food is the choice of mothers, which becomes the subject of pressure and criticism from the society. This leads to stigmatization of the topic, the formation of a sense of guilt in mothers and the label "bad mother", which can destroy the mental balance of the new mother.

We must remember that nothing is more important for the child than the mother's mental state and emotional strength. If we want a physically and mentally healthy, development-oriented child, we must first find support for mothers and, in this regard, stand by them in any choice.
