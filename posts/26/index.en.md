Challenges and difficulties are individual and come in different forms and intensities. If a woman and her family face this unique period prepared and informed, all troubles and complications can be prevented. 

Social factors such as: financial problems and poor living conditions, lack of support from family members and relatives, disharmonious or tense relations with the partner, partner's indifference during such a period have a very acute effect on the already sensitive psyche of a woman.

This period is very hard to women for whom career growth and social self-realization is a priority. It is also worth noting the physical discomfort that accompanies pregnancy/childbirth and postpartum physical rehabilitation: lowering of the small pelvic organs, incisions or post-cesarean incisions, typical pains and complications of lactation, weight gain, skin deformation, changed body shapes, which negatively affect a woman's self-esteem. It reflects and throws you into a great trial.

For prevention, it is recommended to consult with a perinatal psychologist (a psychologist who works on fertility issues, pre and postnatal period). The goal of a psychologist is to help a woman accept and understand herself in a new role, prepare for childbirth and provide information about possible depression and anxiety. Explain the importance of healthy parent-child interaction.
