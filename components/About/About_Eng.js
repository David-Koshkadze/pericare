      <p>
        Society of Perinatal Psychotherapy Of Georgia - "Pericare" is a
        non-governmental organization whose aim is to promote mental health
        before, during and after pregnancy.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Pericare" is a partner of the “Society of Perinatal Psychology and
        Psychotherapy" in Georgia and actively cooperates with the organization
        within the international program "Early Life Care".
      </p>
      <p>
        The main goal of "Pericare" is to offer support and care to parents and
        their newborns during the process of birthing a new life. The birth of a
        child is a complex event, therefore, it is important for parents,
        medical staff and psychologists to coordinate their actions in order to
        avoid difficulties and simplify the responsible mission of caring for a
        child.

        The period from planning a pregnancy, including the birth and
        development of a child, is a time in a woman's life when she faces
        emotional challenges. At this time, it is important for a woman not to
        feel alone, to be given the opportunity to express and share her
        emotions and, if necessary, to receive counseling from a psychologist.

        Importance of psychoeducation and counseling
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          At the stage of pregnancy planning, women often have to deal with such
          challenges as laboratory studies, small and large-scale invasive
          manipulations, which affect the emotional and mental state of the
          woman. A woman may feel hopelessness, lack of control, fear, etc. If a
          woman is not provided with adequate emotional support during this
          time, she may develop mental health problems.
        </li>

        <li>
          In woman's life Pregnancy is a period when her emotional health is
          faced with a great test. It is important for a woman to have
          information about the mental phases of pregnancy, to receive emotional
          support and to heal if she is dealing with certain risks during
          pregnancy.
        </li>

        <li>
          Postpartum depression, a common problem after pregnancy, is not just
          a personal problem, it is an indicator of a social, developmental and
          economic sustainability of the country. According to studies, if
          postpartum depression is prevented and recognized at an early stage,
          the effectiveness of its treatment is much higher, and the recovery
          time is much shorter.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>

        information and services related to perinatal mental health for all

        management and care of the condition in the pre and postnatal period.
