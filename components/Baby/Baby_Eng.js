      <p>
        In an orderly world, this is how it happens: A newborn, whose umbilical
        cord has not yet been cut, is placed on the mother's breast. It's called
        skin-to-skin contact and an hour in complete stillness. After 9 months
        of waiting, as it turned out, the new mother gets a chance to examine
        her newborn's fingers and toes, look into her eyes...
      </p>
      <p>
        As research shows, what happens within an hour after birth is very
        important. It is then that the main emotional bond between mother and
        child is laid, which is very important for the normal growth and
        development of the child.
      </p>
      <p className="font-bold">What happens in next one hour after birth?</p>
      <p>
        The newborn must quickly adapt to the new environment: breathe
        independently, start sucking, hear and see to adjust to sounds and
        bright light. All this takes place thanks to instinctive physiological
        programs right when the baby is lying on the mother's chest. All this
        includes 9 stages.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Crying. A newborn's lungs are filled with air, his vocal cords begin
          to work for the first time, and with a loud cry he announces his birth
          to the world. When he is placed on his mother's chest, he gradually
          calms down because he feels safe.
        </li>
        <li>
          {" "}
          Rest. His eyes are closed, his fists are open, he breathes calmly and
          rests from all the obstacles he had to overcome.
        </li>
        <li>
          Awakening. In 5-10 minutes after birth, the newborn begins to move his
          head and shoulders, opens his eyes, mouth and makes sounds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Activity. The baby's movement is becoming more noticeable. The sucking
          instinct turns on.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rest. After these activities, he falls asleep again and prepares for
          the next important stage.
        </li>
        <li>
          With a pheasant to the breast. A child is born in the so-called
          "Automatic with pheasant instinct". He needs this to reach his
          mother's breast.
        </li>
        <li>
          {" "}
          "relationship" with the breast. The contact of the newborn with the
          breast in both the mother and the child leads to the production of the
          "love and attachment" hormone - oxytocin, which leads to emotional
          attachment between mother and child. In the mammary glands of the
          mother, the production of a useful substance is activated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sucking. 45-60 minutes after birth, the baby starts to suck the breast
          for the first time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sleep. Mother and child sleep peacefully to recover their strength
          after giving birth
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="font-bold">The importance of skin-to-skin contact</p>
      <p>
        Newborns, unlike adults, do not have a fat layer. Therefore, their body
        does not have the ability to adjust their body temperature to the
        ambient temperature. If a newborn gets cold, his body will need a lot of
        energy to stabilize his body temperature. "Skin-to-skin" contact helps
        to normalize the work of the respiratory organs, which have started to
        work. Also, at this time, the heart rate stabilizes, and the risk of
        developing hypoglycemia (low blood glucose level) decreases. The moment
        of cutting the umbilical cord is prolonged. This is a very important
        moment. While the umbilical cord is pulsating, the newborn receives
        oxygen from the umbilical cord, which allows him to calmly learn to
        breathe through the lungs. In addition, while the baby lies on the
        mother's chest, it additionally receives red blood cells from the
        umbilical cord, which reduces the development of iron deficiency anemia
        in newborns.
      </p>
      <p className="font-bold">Natural activation of the immune system</p>
      <p>
        At birth, the newborn passes from a sterile environment to a rather
        non-sterile environment full of the mother's bacteria. This is a very
        important moment that is required for the production of immune cells.
        Even if the birth was not vaginal and a cesarean section occurred,
        skin-to-skin contact still allows the baby's immune system to encounter
        the mother's bacteria. Being by your mother's side means safety, warmth
        and support. Separation is a threat to his life. When the newborn is
        separated from the mother, he loudly protests this, trying to get
        attention. If, despite this, contact with the mother does not occur, the
        child develops the so-called "The Separation Effect."
      </p>
      <p className="font-bold">Easy removal of the placenta</p>
      <p>
        While the newborn is on your breast, labor is still going on because the
        placenta has not yet separated from the uterine walls. "Skin to skin"
        contact with the baby leads to the production of the hormone oxytocin in
        the mother's blood, which stimulates the walls of the uterus and the
        placenta easily goes beyond its walls.
      </p>
      <p>
        The advantage of "golden hour" applies to both mother and father. If the
        mother has had a caesarean section or additional manipulations and
        "skin-to-skin" contact with the mother is not possible, then the father
        fulfills the duty of the mother.
      </p>
      <p>
        New parents face many challenges, including anxiety about their child's
        health. Often, they are influenced by a lot of myths and may be afraid
        of things that are natural for a newborn.

        After childbirth, certain issues related to the mother and the newborn
        may become a cause of anxiety. However, most of them do not pose a
        threat to the mother and the baby. Consider some of them:
      </p>
      <p className="font-bold">Hiccups and burping</p>
      <p>
        Hiccups bother parents more than children. Hiccups are completely normal
        for a newborn. Some babies even start hiccups in the womb, around 6
        months, when their lungs are starting to form. The expectant mother
        feels this with regular pushes in the stomach during pregnancy. Babies
        cry during and sometimes without it, which scares new parents. This is
        called reflux and is not a problem if the baby is gaining weight well.
        As a rule, it will pass by itself by 6 months.
      </p>
      <p className="font-bold">Child's weight</p>
      <p>
        In 5-7 days after birth, it is normal for breastfed children to lose
        7-10% of their birth weight, and for children who are artificially fed -
        by 5%. They usually need 10-14 days to regain their birth weight.
        However, if they lose more weight than normal, are sick or premature,
        they can do it in 3 weeks. It is not advisable to weigh a healthy baby
        every day, as this will increase your anxiety. It is enough to weigh
        yourself on the same scale once a month without clothes, at least for up
        to 6 months. From 1 to 3 years of age, weight control is required every
        3-6 months, from 3-6 years at 6-month intervals, and after 6 years,
        annually
      </p>
      <p className="font-bold">Mother's weight</p>
      <p>
        Maybe you expected to come out at your pre-pregnancy weight and were
        disappointed. Remember that this is temporary.
      </p>
      <p className="font-bold">Breastfeeding</p>
      <p>
        Because you can't count exactly how many grams of breast milk a baby
        drinks, mothers often doubt whether they have enough milk to feed their
        child or not. During the first 6 months, breast milk provides the baby
        with all the nutrients it needs for growth and development. If the baby
        latches on to the breast properly, removes it completely and feeds on
        demand, he will definitely get enough breast milk.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose to formula feed your child or for some reason you can't
        breastfeed, don't feel guilty. The child reflects your emotions and your
        happiness is important to him.
      </p>
      <p className="font-bold">Cramps in sleep</p>
      <p>
        Babies often jump in their sleep, which even wakes you up. This is
        annoying for you, but it is normal. Babies are born with a variety of
        reflexes, including the Moro reflex – if your baby is startled by a
        noise or his head position suddenly changes, he may react by suddenly
        extending his arms and legs, then returning them to their original
        position.
      </p>
      <p className="font-bold">Crying</p>
      <p>
        Through crying, the baby talks to you, lets you know his needs. It could
        be a spilled diaper, boredom, hunger, asking to be close to you, colic,
        etc.
      </p>
      <p className="font-bold">Sneezing</p>
      <p>
        Sneezing in infancy is normal, and children are trying to clear their
        nose of foreign particles, such as spilled milk.
      </p>
      <p className="font-bold">Peer comparison</p>
      <p>
        No matter how much you think that you should not compare your baby to
        anyone else, sometimes you still feel in your heart that "the first
        child behaved well at this age" or "the neighbor's child is this age and
        already smiling". Remember that each child develops individually and the
        main thing is to comply with the established norms of development.
      </p>
      <p className="font-bold">Comparison with other mothers</p>
      <p>
        Both children and mothers are different. Some manage to do everything,
        some can't brush their hair all day. There are women who love their
        fetus in the womb and those who need time for it. Some raise a child
        alone, while others are helped by several people to take care of it.
        This is all normal and do not tire yourself with heavy thoughts.
      </p>
      <p className="font-bold">Sleep</p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, new parents worry about their newborn's sleepiness or
        insomnia. Pediatricians and child development researchers confirm that
        newborns can sleep more or less than they should (14-17 hours a day).
        "Fast growth days", colic, health problems, etc. can become an obstacle
        to sleep. This is not alarming, you will learn over time how to promote
        his peaceful sleep.
