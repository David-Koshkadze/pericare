      <p>
        &quot;What will childbirth be like for me and my child?&quot; - This
        question probably arises for every mother, and as childbirth approaches,
        it becomes more and more intense. Despite theoretical preparation, each
        birth process is individual and it may be difficult for a woman to deal
        with unexpected challenges that cannot be planned and controlled in
        advance. The course and results of childbirth are related to both the
        physical and mental realms. The physical consequences can be very
        diverse, and their negative effects are amplified by the unwanted mental
        consequences as well. Psychological effects at conscious and unconscious
        levels affect behavior and personality structure.

      <p>
        About 40-50 years ago, it was believed that the child cannot experience
        the birth process and has no sensation. Based on new research, today
        scientists have a completely opposite position. Infant research also
        shows us that even before birth, a child is a sensitive being and
        experiences much more than we thought before.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the period of intrauterine existence, the child learns about the
        mother&#39;s feelings, emotions, various experiences, and it develops
        its own perception and observation skills. This experience is reflected
        in the form of primary traces on the developing brain and nervous system
        of the fetus. These early changes in gene activity affect the entire
        later life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Based on the new knowledge that the child experiences the pre-birth
        period and the birth itself individually, the question arises as to what
        degree and intensity the traumatic birth affects the child&#39;s
        development.
      </p>

      <p>
        Often, children have to endure hours of pain, medication, complications,
        medical manipulations and extreme stress.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, the time immediately after birth, when the newborn has to cope
        with completely new living conditions, is stressful for the child. After
        nine months in 37 degree heat, in a stress-free, protected environment,
        to suddenly find yourself in a ventilated, brightly lit maternity ward
        is likely to be anything but a pleasant welcome for the baby. Also,
        hygienic procedures, studies and separation from the mother exceed the
        adaptation capabilities of the newborn.
