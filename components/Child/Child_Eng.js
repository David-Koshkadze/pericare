      <p>
        Early childhood is a critically important period in a person's life. The
        age from birth to six years is an amazingly fast and unique period of
        growth, it is during this time that the brain develops most rapidly and
        intensively, which is the basis for later human life. At an early age,
        it is especially important to positively support each child and offer
        them a variety of experiences. The main form of behavior, learning and
        development of a child at an early age is playing. The game is a way for
        the child to learn about the world, express himself and communicate.
        This process is a source of feeling of naturalness, security,
        satisfaction and pleasure for him. A child actively learns by doing. He
        learns by discovering the environment, by actively engaging in the
        process, by constantly trying and experimenting. That's why it's
        important for a child to make mistakes, try different ideas, test their
        abilities. It is preferable for him not to receive ready knowledge and
        information, but to get to know the world through his own experience.
        Child development is a complex and multifaceted process. Conditionally
        divided areas of development help us to give equal attention to all
        aspects of development.
      </p>
      <p className="font-bold">
        We offer a brief description of five closely related areas of
        development:
      </p>
      <p>(1) Physical development;</p>
      <p>(2) Development of independence;</p>
      <p>(3) Speech development;</p>
      <p>(4) Cognitive development;</p>
      <p>(5) Social-emotional development.</p>
      <p className="font-bold">Physical development</p>
      <p>
        Physical development refers to skills that help a child move (gross
        motor skills), use fingers (fine motor skills) and senses (hearing,
        seeing, smelling, tasting, touching). Physical activity is very
        important for the full development of a child. It contributes to the
        growth of the child, forms a healthy body, strong muscles and bones.
        Physical activity contributes to brain development, concentration and
        thinking, as well as the child's mental health.
      </p>
      <p className="font-bold">Development of independence</p>
      <p>
        The development of independence implies the formation of a child's
        autonomy at an early age, the ability to show initiative and make
        choices, the skills of independent dressing, feeding and self-service,
        as well as the feeling of safety and security, the skills of getting
        used to and adapting to a new environment. Supporting the development of
        independence from an early age has a positive effect on the child's
        self-confidence, emotional and social development. When a child's
        independence is encouraged, he becomes more motivated, he knows himself
        better, his abilities, he can take care of himself and also tries to
        help others, he is more communicative, he can cooperate, he is more
        sensitive to the needs of others.
      </p>
      <p className="font-bold">Speech development</p>
      <p>
        Speech development is the child's ability to express his emotions,
        thoughts, ideas and opinions through words. Speech combines a child's
        speaking, communication, and storytelling skills, as well as a child's
        ability to listen to and understand what others are saying. Pre-literacy
        and pre-reading skills in preschool age belong to this area. The
        development of speech begins during the period of the baby's womb, when
        he hears his mother's speech. Speech helps the child to interact with
        the outside world, to communicate with the people around him.
        Accordingly, a child who has developed speech skills can easily express
        his opinions, can understand other people's speech. This circumstance
        helps the child to adapt to the outside world and society.
      </p>
      <p className="font-bold">Cognitive development</p>
      <p>
        Cognitive development refers to the development of the child's skills
        that his brain uses for thinking and learning. These skills are:
        interest in new things, asking questions, making assumptions, paying
        attention, observing things and events, trying, experimenting,
        classifying, comparing, causality, analyzing, critical thinking,
        symbolic thinking, using imaginary objects, imagining, interpreting,
        problem solving and creation. Curiosity is the main driving force and
        motivator for children. Therefore, it is important to use curiosity and
        stimulate it by offering new experiences, finding children's interests,
        may be the key to establish communication with him and promote further
        development.

        className="my-4 mx-auto"
      />

      <p>
        In order to get to know the world, while observing objects, the child's
        brain begins to understand that objects are somehow similar and somehow
        different from each other, and begins to sort them into different
        categories, such as color, shape, size, etc. For cognitive development,
        it is also important to understand cause-and-effect relationships and
        logical thinking. During the development of symbolic thinking, the child
        uses something with a symbolic purpose. For example, very young children
        may use a stick as a horse, a box as a telephone. This helps the child
        to understand at the next stage that words are used to name something or
        numbers are used to express quantity. Creative thinking leads to the
        development of problem solving skills. When a child has developed
        creative thinking, he can come up with a new solution to a problem,
        express his emotions, express his opinion through various forms of art
        and literature.
      </p>
      <p className="font-bold">Social-emotional development</p>
      <p>
        Social-emotional development includes the skills that children have in
        learning about themselves, recognizing their own emotions, managing
        impulses and behavior, forming more positive relationships with peers,
        etc. Children who have developed social-emotional skills better know
        themselves and their abilities, have confidence in themselves, their
        abilities and live better with peers and adults. Developing
        social-emotional skills helps children succeed both in school and in
        adult lifeâ€”they perform better academically while they're studying, and
        they're better able to deal with both work and other life challenges as
        adults.
